 * Wraps an action in instrumentation to capture errors and send them to Sentry
 * We also make sure to always return an object, so that if the client doesn't get a response,
 * it's because there was an error, and likely it was a timeout because otherwise it would receive the response.
 * We also handle thrown errors and convert them to an object with an error message.
 * Actions are expected to return { error: string } objects when they fail, but if an error is thrown, we handle it here.
 * NOTE: future updates: we can do more when errors are thrown like we do with `withError` middleware for API routes.
