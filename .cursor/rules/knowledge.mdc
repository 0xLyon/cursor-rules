# Knowledge Base

The knowledge base helps users store and manage information that can be used to help draft responses to emails. It acts as a personal database of information that can be referenced when composing replies.

## Overview

Users can create, edit, and delete knowledge base entries. Each entry consists of:

- A title for quick reference
- Content that contains the actual information
- Metadata like creation and update timestamps

## Database Schema

The `Knowledge` model in Prisma:

```prisma
model Knowledge {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  title     String
  content   String

  userId String
  user   User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}
```

Each knowledge entry belongs to a specific user and is automatically deleted if the user is deleted (cascade).

## Main Files and Directories

The knowledge base functionality is implemented in:

- `apps/web/app/(app)/automation/knowledge/KnowledgeBase.tsx` - Main UI component
- `apps/web/app/(app)/automation/knowledge/KnowledgeForm.tsx` - Form for creating/editing entries
- `apps/web/utils/actions/knowledge.ts` - Server actions for CRUD operations
- `apps/web/utils/actions/knowledge.validation.ts` - Zod validation schemas
- `apps/web/app/api/knowledge/route.ts` - API route for fetching entries

## Features

- **Create**: Users can add new knowledge entries with a title and content
- **Read**: Entries are displayed in a table with title and last updated date
- **Update**: Users can edit existing entries
- **Delete**: Entries can be deleted with a confirmation dialog

## Usage in Email Responses

The knowledge base entries are used to help draft responses to emails. When composing a reply, the system can reference these entries to include relevant information, ensuring consistent and accurate responses.

When drafting responses, we use two LLMs:
1. A cheaper LLM that can process a lot of data (e.g. Google Gemini 2 Flash)
2. A more expensive LLM to draft the response (e.g. Anthropic Sonnet 3.7)

The cheaper LLM is an agent that extracts the key information needed for the drafter LLM.
For example, the knowledge base may include 100 pages of contentm, and the LLM extracts half a page of knowledge to pass to the more drafter LLM.
